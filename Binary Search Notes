Lower Bound Trick :- 

Lower Bound is applicable for sorted array only. For a number 'target' lower bound is defined as the lowest index 'i' in the array for which is x[i] >= target

For example lets consider the array :- [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,7,9,9,10]

Lower Bound of 2 = 3 (3 is index)
Lower Bound of 1 = 0 (0 is index)
Lower Bound of 4 = 8 (8 is index)
Lower Bound of 10 = 11 (11 is index)
Lower Bound of 13 = 12 (size of array)

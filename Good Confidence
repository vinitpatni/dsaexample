1. num of islands (graph dfs)
   TimeComplexity -> O(m*n)
   SpaceComplexity ->O(m*n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack but auxiallary space can be O(1) wtihout using visibility matrix to track visited cell, just flip 1 to 0 after visiting 
all subsets (recursive backtracking)
two numbers.  (array)
two numbers sorted array (array)
My Calendar 1 (interval tree)
Check Validity of BST (tree)
Sudoku Solver. (recursive backtracking)
8. Number of Provinces (dfs)
Sliding Window Maximum (sliding window)
level order traversal (tree)
   TimeComplexity -> O(n) as we are travesing each node once
   SpaceComplexity ->O(n) as in worst case max no of elements at level can be n/2 which we are storing in Queue
reverse stack with recursion(Stack)
merge k sorted array (using priority queue)
bulb right flip (greedy approach)
daily temperature (monotonic stack)
first non repeating number in stream (queue)
min stack (Stack) use Single Stack
implement queue using two stack
peak in mountain array (using binary search)
find in mountain array (double binary search)
wordsearch (dfs backtracking)
reverse words (String)
min window substring (sliding window)
longest-substring-without-repeating-characters(sliding window)
network delay time : (Dijkistra algortihm)
Design inmemory file system
serialize and deserialize n-ary tree
Snapshot Array :- (use binary search)
encode and decode list of strings
Visible people of queue :- (use monotonic stack)
searilize and deseralize tree :- use preorder traversal
Longest palindrome substring (dynamic programming and tabulation technique)
Bottom level order traversal (same as level order traversal but use LinkedList to add at start, which supports addFirst method)
kth largest element in stream
meetings room (interval )
diameter of tree (tree dfs)
Max Area of Island (Graph dfs)
  TimeComplexity -> O(m*n)
  SpaceComplexity ->O(m*n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack but auxiallary space can be O(1) wtihout using visibility matrix to track visited cell, just flip 1 to 0 after visiting 
Disappering elements in array (cyclic sort)
longest palindromic substring (tabulation technique using bottomsup approach)
